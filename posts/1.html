  At the moment, I am learning Java on <a href="https://www.coursera.org">this website</a>. It is going well thus far and is rather interesting. The course is 88 (though most of these are because of what I believe to be an over-estimation of time to complete projects) hours long, hopefully by the end of it I will have comprehensive knowledge of the programming language... I have completed 4% of the program so far. I quite like Java thus far, though the syntax is much more complex than that of the other languages I know (to an extent) thus far. <br><br><code>
class Main { <br>
  public static void main(String[] args) { <br>
  &nbsp; int a;<br>
  &nbsp; int b;<br>
  &nbsp;  a = 1234;<br>
  &nbsp;  b = 99;<br>
  &nbsp; int c = a + b;<br>
  &nbsp;  System.out.println(c);<br>
  &nbsp;}<br>
}
</code>
<br>
<p>
Above is a basic program that adds 2 numbers together to make 1333 and stores it in a variable called 'c' and prints the result. The file is called Main.java of course. The syntax as you can see there looks rather complicated. But it is fun to learn (at the moment). 
This site here will document what I learn hopefully.
</p>
<p>
Having a website will encourage me to learn things so that I do have something to update at the end of the day, and also ensures that as I learn other programming languages my knowledge of HTML, CSS (and the minimal knowledge I do hold of JavaScript) does not rot away. At the moment though, I am hoping to learn as much Java as possible (<i>if</i>&nbsp; my schoolwork does not impede me)!
